## About me:

I'm Reason Wong, 黄岩 in Chinese.<br/>
and I am Chinese.<br/>
I was born in a flat country,<br/>
then grew up near the sea.<br/>

I started programming since high school,<br/>
I played with these languages(sort by time ASC)<br/>
-> VB(enlightment)<br/>
-> C++(almost forgotten)<br/>
-> PHP(the best lol)<br/>
-> JavaScript(mostly)<br/>
-> Python(recently)

This site is not really a blog for public readers,<br/>
it's just my notes, posts, some series, balderdash, abracadabra.<br/>
